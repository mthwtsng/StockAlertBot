# Stock Alert Bot

Stock Alert Bot is a Discord bot built with Python that delivers real-time stock price alerts directly to your Discord server. Leveraging the Discord API, yFinance for market data, MongoDB for scalable alert storage, and Pandas for efficient data manipulation, this bot provides a robust solution for managing user-generated stock alerts.

## Features

- **Real-Time Stock Alerts:**  
  Continuously monitors stock prices with a background task that checks every 5 seconds and sends notifications when prices meet alert conditions.

- **Asynchronous & Event-Driven:**  
  Built on Python's `asyncio` to handle multiple concurrent operationsâ€”ensuring low latency and responsive user interactions.

- **Custom Caching Layer:**  
  Implements a TTL-based caching mechanism (via a custom `PriceCache` class) to reduce redundant API calls and improve performance.

- **Robust Database Integration:**  
  Utilizes MongoDB to perform CRUD operations for user-generated alerts, enabling efficient management and scalability.

- **Modular Design:**  
  Organized into separate modules (commands, tasks, and utilities) for maintainability and ease of extension.

## Configuration
 Before running the bot, configure your credentials and settings:

- **Discord Bot Token:**
Update the BOT_TOKEN in config.py with your Discord bot token.

- **MongoDB URI:**
Set your MongoDB connection string in config.py.

- **Cache Settings:**
Adjust CACHE_TTL (time-to-live) for the caching system if needed.

Example `config.py`:

```bash
# config.py
BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
MONGO_URI = "YOUR_MONGODB_URI"
CACHE_TTL = 30  # Time-to-live for cached stock prices in seconds
```
